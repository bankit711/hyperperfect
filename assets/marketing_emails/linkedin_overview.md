# LinkedIn Page Overview - HyperPerfect

**HyperPerfect** brings AI directly into Excel, giving analysts the accuracy and speed that generic AI tools can't deliver inside a spreadsheet.

AI models were built on natural language, not spreadsheet formulas. Cell references, date formats, and Excel conventions cause constant hallucinations and errors. Our proprietary data translation layer fixes this, reducing AI errors by 95% and improving comprehension by 10x, even on large datasets with 500,000+ rows.

With HyperPerfect, Excel becomes an AI agent that builds models, cleans messy data, extracts PDFs, searches the web, and makes dashboards look professional. All with enterprise-grade security and your data staying private.

We're currently onboarding beta users. Try it free in Excel Online or desktop.
