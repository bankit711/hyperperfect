# Cold Outreach v2 - Beta Signup

## Target: Marketing & Analytics Excel Users
## Angle: Claude momentum / wave

    Hey {{FirstName}},

    Claude is taking over data and analytics.  Teams everywhere are using it to automate reporting, clean messy datasets, and build models in a fraction of the time.

    But if you've tried using it with Excel, you've probably hit the same wall I did.  Cell references, date formats, and spreadsheet conventions confuse AI models and cause constant errors.

    We built HyperPerfect to fix that.  It brings Claude directly into Excel and adds a data translation layer that gives AI a powerful lens to view your spreadsheets.  The result is 95% fewer errors and 10x better comprehension, especially with large datasets.

    We're signing up beta testers right now, so you can access it for free before our public launch.  It takes about 15 minutes to get you up and running.

    Would you be up for trying it?

    Best,
    Dave
