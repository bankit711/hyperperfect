# Cold Outreach - Beta Signup

## Target: Marketing & Analytics Excel Users

Hey {{FirstName}},

I'm a tech founder who spent the last year trying to get AI to work reliably with spreadsheets.  We learned it isn't a natural combination.  Excel's conventions for cell references, dates, and formatting confuse AI models and cause constant errors.

So we built HyperPerfect, which brings Claude directly into Excel and adds a data translation layer that gives AI a powerful lens to view your spreadsheets.  The result is 95% fewer errors and 10x better comprehension, especially when working with large amounts of data.

We're signing up beta testers right now, so you can access it for free before our public launch.  It takes about 15 minutes to get you up and running.

Would you be up for trying it?

Best,
Dave
