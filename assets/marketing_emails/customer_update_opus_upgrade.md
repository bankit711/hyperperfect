Hey {{contact.FIRSTNAME}},

Quick update. We just shipped the single most significant performance boost for AI in Excel.

**Claude Opus 4.6 is now live in HyperPerfect.**

Opus 4.6 is Anthropic's most powerful model to date, and we're seeing it perform at an entirely new level inside Excel. Smarter formula construction, fewer errors, and significantly better handling of complex multi-sheet models.

One-shotting a dynamic, formula-driven three-statement forecast without errors is now a reality.

We ran an AI Excel Challenge, Claude alone vs. Claude + HyperPerfect, building a full three-statement financial model from scratch. The results:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Claude alone:** 2 critical errors in 15 minutes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Claude + HyperPerfect:** 0 critical errors in 9 minutes

To be clear, Claude alone producing only two critical errors was incredibly impressive. Prior models couldn't come close to that. But HyperPerfect's spreadsheet translation engine closed the gap entirely. Zero critical errors. 40% faster. That's our value.

You can see the full breakdown, methodology, and video walkthroughs here:

This is what we've been building toward. AI that actually works reliably in Excel, not just most of the time, but consistently enough to trust with real work.

**Two more things you'll notice:**

**Redesigned UI.** We rebuilt the interface from the ground up. Cleaner, faster, and easier to navigate, especially when working through multi-step analyses.

**Custom Instructions.** This is a big one. You can now set persistent instructions that tailor HyperPerfect's outputs to your specific business. Revenue recognition rules, naming conventions, preferred formula structures, reporting formats. Define them once and every output reflects your standards. It turns a general purpose tool into one that knows your spreadsheets.

Keep an eye out: we're building toward bulletproof customized workflows. If you have something specific you want to discuss, reply to this email and let's chat.

Best,
Dave
