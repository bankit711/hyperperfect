Hey {{ contact.FIRSTNAME | default: "there" }},

Two important updates.

**We're rolling out pricing plans and monthly usage limits.**

Up until now, usage has been open. Starting today, each account will have a monthly usage allowance based on your plan. We've kept it simple: every feature is available on every plan. The only difference is how much you can use each month.

- **Free.** $0 forever. 5x usage for your first month.
- **Starter.** $20/month. For occasional users who want AI assist when they need it.
- **Pro.** $50/month. For regular users who rely on AI in their daily Excel work.
- **Power.** $180/month. For power users running complex analyses and heavy daily use.

No feature gates. No surprises. Your settings panel shows a real-time usage bar so you always know where you stand.

**To help you get the most from your allowance, we just upgraded Fast mode to Claude Sonnet 4.6.**

Anthropic released Sonnet 4.6 today and we've already rolled it in. This matters because Sonnet 4.6 approaches Opus-level quality at a fraction of the usage cost. Developers preferred it over the previous version 70% of the time, and Anthropic specifically calls out major improvements in spreadsheet navigation and financial analysis.

In practical terms: many tasks that previously required Smart mode (Opus) to get right can now be handled in Fast mode. That means better results while consuming less of your monthly allowance. Smart mode is still there for the heaviest reasoning work, but you'll find yourself needing it less often.

**In case you missed it, here's what we've shipped recently:**

- **Claude Opus 4.6 (Smart mode).** Anthropic's most powerful reasoning model. One-shots complex financial models with zero errors.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Fast mode).** Just launched. Approaches Opus-level quality at a fraction of the cost.
- **Redesigned UI.** Rebuilt from the ground up. Cleaner, faster, easier to navigate.
- **Custom Instructions.** Persistent rules for your business: naming conventions, formula structures, reporting formats. Define once, apply everywhere.
- **File Attachments.** Drop in images and PDFs (up to 32 MB) for context.

We've shipped a lot in a short time. The product is meaningfully better than it was a few weeks ago, and these pricing plans reflect the value it now delivers.
