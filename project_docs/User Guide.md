## Clean Operation

### Why Data Cleaning Matters

Most revenue analysis gets derailed by messy datasets. You're trying to understand recurring revenue, but your "revenue by month" data is actually billing data full of:

- **Refunds and account adjustments** that distort patterns
- **Partial billing periods** that under-represent churn
- **Missed revenue periods** that create false churn
- **Inconsistent formats** (monthly vs annual data)

**Manual cleaning takes hours.** You're building complicated Excel formulas, manually editing cells, and second-guessing every adjustment. By the time you're done cleaning, there's no time to actually analyze.

### How HyperPerfect Solves This

Set your cleaning rules once, apply them instantly:

- ✅ **Fix double billing periods** automatically
- ✅ **Handle partial billing periods** with smart logic
- ✅ **Convert between time periods** (monthly to annual, etc.)
- ✅ **Dynamic formulas** - change cleaning rules anytime, results flow to dashboards automatically

### Clean Options

#### Data Source

- **Choose Input Sheet**: Select the worksheet containing your source data.

#### Conversion Settings

- **Monthly to Annual Adjustment**: Apply a multiplier to convert between revenue types.
    
    - **None**: No conversion (multiplier = 1)
    - **Monthly → Annual**: Multiply monthly values by 12
    - **Annual → Monthly**: Divide annual values by 12
- **Unit Conversion**: Apply a conversion factor to standardize units.
    
    - **None**: No conversion (multiplier = 1)
    - **÷ 1,000**: Divide values by 1,000 (e.g., $1,000 → $1)
    - **÷ 1,000,000**: Divide values by 1,000,000 (e.g., $1M → $1)
    - **× 1,000**: Multiply values by 1,000
    - **× 1,000,000**: Multiply values by 1,000,000

#### Period Settings

- **Adjust Partial Periods**: Fix partial month amounts at revenue stream start/end
    
    - Partial month values at beginning are grossed up to next month's value
    - Partial month values at end are adjusted to zero
- **Plug Revenue Gaps**: Fill gaps in revenue streams automatically
    
    - **No**: Don't fill gaps
    - **Up to 1 Month**: Fill gaps up to 1 month in length
    - **Up to 2 Months**: Fill gaps up to 2 months in length
- **Remove Overlapping Values**: Eliminate double-counting
    
    - If revenue amount equals sum of prior and next periods, adjust to next period amount

#### Revenue Settings

- **Exclude Small Revenue Amounts**: Set minimum threshold - anything below becomes zero

### How to Use Clean

1. Navigate to the **Clean** tab in the add-in
2. Select your source data worksheet from **Choose Input Sheet** dropdown
3. Configure your desired cleaning options
4. Click **Clean Source Data with Formulas**
5. New worksheet created: `[SourceSheet]_Clean`
6. Contains formulas that transform data according to your options

## Analyze Operation

### Why Manual Analysis Is Broken

Analysts constantly rebuild the same analysis over and over. It takes forever, and every time they make mistakes. The endless cycle:

- Clean data → Organize data → Fix data → Build calculations → Create summaries → Present to boss → Find mistake → Start over

**Nothing kills credibility faster than showing up with incorrect calculations.** Your boss spots one error, and suddenly all your insights are questioned.

### How HyperPerfect Changes This

**Focus on insights, not busywork.** We eliminate the manual work so you can:

- ✨ Draw insights from clean, accurate calculations
- ✨ Tell the story your data reveals
- ✨ Make recommendations that drive business decisions
- ✨ Build credibility with bulletproof analysis

### Building Revenue Data

Transform your source data into analysis-ready format with cohort context.

#### Options

- **Choose Input Sheet**: Select worksheet containing source data
- **Fiscal Year End**: Select month representing end of your fiscal year

#### How to Use

1. Navigate to **Analyze** tab
2. Select source data worksheet from **Choose Input Sheet** dropdown
3. Select fiscal year end month from **Fiscal Year End** dropdown
4. Click **Build Revenue Data**
5. New worksheet created: `[SourceSheet]_Revenue`

### Quarterly & Annual Summaries

**The Hidden Quarterly Nightmare**: Quarterly summaries are where most Excel analyses go wrong. Fiscal vs. calendar quarters break Excel formulas, and one misaligned cell reference destroys everything.

**HyperPerfect's Solution**:

- **Fiscal year aware** - set your fiscal start month once, works forever
- **Perfect month mapping** - no more pointing to wrong cells
- **Smart revenue walk logic** - automatically chooses first month, sum, or last month
- **Instant generation** - what takes hours now happens in seconds

### Pivot Tables

Create cohort analyses with perfect quarterly and annual summaries.

#### Options

- **Select Primary Dimension**: Choose primary dimension for pivot table
- **Rows**: Select how to group data
    - **Monthly Cohorts**: Group by month
    - **Quarterly Cohorts**: Group by quarter
    - **Annual Cohorts**: Group by year
- **Select Period**: Choose time period for analysis
    - **Months**: Show monthly data
    - **Quarters**: Show quarterly data
    - **Annual**: Show annual data

#### How to Use

1. After building revenue data, select desired pivot table options
2. Click **Run Pivot Tables**
3. New pivot table created in new worksheet

## Revenue Waterfall Operation

### Why Revenue Walks Are Complex

Revenue waterfall quarterly summaries are especially tricky because different metrics need different approaches:

- **🔸 Starting Revenue**: Use first month of the period
- **🔸 New Revenue**: Sum all months in the period
- **🔸 Ending Revenue**: Use last month of the period

**HyperPerfect knows this automatically** and applies the right logic for each metric.

### Waterfall Options

- **Metric**: Choose between Revenue or Customer Count analysis
- **Show Cohorts**: Group data by cohort types:
    - **All**: No cohort grouping
    - **Monthly Cohorts**: Group by month
    - **Quarterly Cohorts**: Group by quarter
    - **Annual Cohorts**: Group by year
- **Dimension Filter**: Filter data by specific dimension (Product, Region, etc.)
- **Select Included Value(s)**: Choose specific values for filtered dimension

### How to Use Waterfall

1. Navigate to **Analyze** tab
2. Select source data worksheet from **Choose Input Sheet** dropdown
3. Select desired metric from **Metric** dropdown
4. Choose cohort grouping from **Show Cohorts** dropdown
5. Optionally select dimension filter and values to include
6. Click **Revenue Waterfall**
7. New worksheet created: `[SourceSheet]_Waterfall`
8. Waterfall analysis shows:
    - Revenue breakdown by time period
    - New business, expansion, contraction, churn components
    - Visual representation of revenue changes

## Performance Optimization

### The Excel Performance Problem

Working with thousands of rows? Most Excel users hit a wall when spreadsheets get large:

- Excel becomes sluggish with thousands of formulas recalculating
- Files take forever to open, save, or scroll through
- Simple edits trigger minutes of recalculation time

### HyperPerfect's Smart Solution

**Formula-to-Values Conversion** (in General Settings):

- ✅ **Eliminates thousands of formulas** that slow Excel down
- ✅ **Keeps first-row formulas intact** for each analysis
- ✅ **Copy/paste formulas anytime** you need them back
- ✅ **Values stay accurate** - formulas just aren't recalculating constantly

### How to Enable Performance Mode

1. Run any HyperPerfect analysis (Cohort Builder or Revenue Waterfall)
2. Go to **General Settings** and enable **"Convert output formulas to values"**
3. Run the analysis again and feel the difference in speed
4. Try copying formulas from the first row - they'll paste and work perfectly!

**Real-World Impact**: A customer with 100,000 rows told us this feature transformed their workflow from "unusable" to "instant."
