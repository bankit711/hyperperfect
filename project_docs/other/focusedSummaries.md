  - *quartersYears.js*: Generates fiscal quarter and year summary headers.
  
- **Worksheet Builders:**
  - *chunkProcessor.js*: Processes data in chunks to support efficient batch operations.
  - *dataIngestionStream.js*: Loads and validates Excel data in a memory-efficient, streamed manner.
  - *DimensionsManager.js*: Manages worksheet dimensions, updates ranges, and inserts special columns (e.g., period summaries, Start/Cancel).
  - *streamOperations.js*: Provides streaming and batching functions.
  - *styleOperations.js*: Manages Excel styling and conditional formatting.
  - *worksheetBuilderFormulaManager.js*: Applies formula strategies to worksheet ranges using batching and caching.
  - *worksheetBuilderInitialization.js*: Sets up the target worksheet, initializes dimensions, and applies conditional formatting.
