### Added

#### Full Workbook LLM Access
HyperPerfect AI can now see and work with all sheets in your Excel workbook, not just the currently active sheet.

**What's New:**
- **Access All Sheets**: The AI assistant can now view information about every sheet in your workbook and intelligently choose which one to work with
- **Smarter Sheet Selection**: The AI understands your workbook structure and automatically selects the right sheet for your task
- **Clear Operation Tracking**: When the AI makes changes, it now clearly shows you which sheet it's modifying
- **Seamless Multi-Sheet Workflows**: Work with complex workbooks containing multiple related sheets without manually switching between them

**How It Helps You:**
- Consolidate data across multiple sheets without manual coordination
- Ask the AI to find and analyze data scattered across different sheets

- See exactly which sheets are being modified as the AI works
