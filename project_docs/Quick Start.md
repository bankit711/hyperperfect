### Sample Data Format

Your data should look like this, starting in cell A1:

|Customer|Product|1/1/25|2/1/25|3/1/25|4/1/25|5/1/25|6/1/25|
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|Microsoft|Excel|1,430|1,501|1,504|1,509|1,540|1,539|
|Apple|Numbers|101|102|115|110|109|112|
|Google|Sheets|556|575|599|625|655|689|

**Requirements:**

- Dimensional data columns (customer names, attributes)
- Monthly revenue data with date-formatted headers
- Data table starting in cell A1

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Clean Your Data (Optional but Recommended)

**Why Clean First?** Most revenue analysis gets derailed by messy datasets full of refunds, partial billing periods, and format inconsistencies. Manual cleaning takes hours and is error-prone.

**How to Clean:**

1. Navigate to the **Clean Dashboard**
2. Select your source worksheet from **"Choose Input Sheet"** dropdown
3. Configure cleaning options:
    - **Monthly to Annual Adjustment**: Convert between revenue types
    - **Unit Conversion**: Standardize to thousands/millions
    - **Adjust Partial Periods**: Fix partial month amounts
    - **Plug Revenue Gaps**: Fill missing periods automatically
    - **Remove Overlapping Values**: Eliminate double-counting
4. Click **"Clean Source Data with Formulas"**
5. New worksheet created: `[SourceSheet]_Clean`

**Pro Tip**: Multiple adjustments can be applied simultaneously. All cleaning uses dynamic formulas, so changes flow through automatically.

### 2. Build Revenue Context

**Why This Step Matters:** Raw data doesn't have the context needed for cohort analysis. This step adds fiscal year awareness and quarterly summaries.

**How to Build:**

1. Navigate to the **Analyze Dashboard**
2. Select your worksheet (cleaned data or original) from **"Choose Input Sheet"** dropdown
3. Choose fiscal year-end from dropdown (if other than December)
4. Click **"Build Revenue Data"**
5. New worksheet created: `[SourceSheet]_Revenue`

**What You Get:**

- Cohort details for each customer
- Quarterly and annual summaries (fiscal year aware)
- Start/cancel month context for waterfall analysis

### 3. Create Revenue Waterfall

**Why Waterfalls Are Powerful:** Revenue waterfalls show how your revenue changes over time, breaking down growth into new business, expansion, contraction, and churn components.

**How to Build:**

1. After building revenue data, stay in **Analyze Dashboard**
2. Configure waterfall options:
    - **Metric**: Choose Revenue or Customer Count
    - **Show Cohorts**: Group by Monthly, Quarterly, Annual, or All
    - **Dimension Filter**: Filter by Product, Region, etc. (optional)
    - **Select Values**: Choose specific segments to include
3. Click **"Revenue Waterfall"**
4. New worksheet created: `[SourceSheet]_Waterfall`

**Advanced Feature - Dynamic Filtering:**

- Use dimension columns to compare segments (Enterprise vs. Starter)
- Pick multiple values to compare simultaneously
- Adjust results on the fly using spreadsheet filter columns
