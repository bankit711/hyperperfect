## How the AI Works with Excel

### 1. Planning is key

**Before asking HyperPerfect to execute on tasks:**

1. AI can't read your mind, and does much better when it has lots of context.  Spend a prompt or two telling it what you want and asking it to come up with a plan.  Once agreed, then you can ask it to move forward.
2. DO NOT expect AI to magically build huge spreadsheets in one shot.  Experts know that AI does best with manageable, discrete tasks.  Iteration is your friend.
3. HyperPerfect will natrually focuse on your current sheet, but can see others as well.  If you want it to focus on certain data, refert to it specifically and/or highlight it before entering your prompt

### 2. Ask Naturally

**The AI understands requests like:**

- "What patterns do you see in this data?"
- "Create a summary table showing sales by region"
- "Add a yellow background to highlight values over 100"
- "Add a year-over-year growth column using formulas"
- "Create a professional P&L statement from this data"

### 3. Watch the AI Work

**You'll see:**

1. **Thinking blocks** showing the AI's reasoning process
2. **Tool cards** showing Excel operations as they happen
3. **Real-time results** appearing directly in your Excel workbook
4. **Stop button** - click anytime to pause and redirect the AI

### 4. Refine and Iterate

**Continue the conversation:**

- "Now add summary period columns showing quarterly results"
- "Redo the formulas to show average instead of median"
- "Make the formatting better"
- "Double-check all the formulas"

The AI remembers context and builds on previous work until you clear the conversation.

## File Attachments

You can upload files for the AI to analyze alongside your Excel data:

**Supported formats:**
- **Images**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP (max 5 MB each)
- **Documents**: PDF (max 32 MB, 100 pages)

**How to attach:**
1. Click the **paperclip icon** or use **@attach**
2. Or drag and drop files onto the chat
3. Attached files appear above the input box
4. Click **X** on any file to remove it from context

## Advanced Tips & Features

### Complex Multi-Step Tasks

**Make AI work better:**

- Ask HyperPerfect for the prompt to do the task you want
- Build up AI's context before allowing it to work
- Complete complex work in manageable steps

**Example request:**
```
"What would be a good prompt to have AI build a balance sheet with this data?"
```

### Context Memory

**The AI remembers:**

- Your previous questions in the conversation
- Data you've selected and worked with
- Formatting preferences you've expressed
- Analysis goals you've mentioned

**This enables natural follow-ups:**

- "Now do the same for last quarter"
- "Apply that to the entire dataset"
- "Create a similar chart for revenue"

### Managing Context

When your conversation gets long, the context indicator will show higher percentages. You can:

- Use **@compact** to summarize old messages and free space
- Use **@clear** to start completely fresh
- The system will auto-compact at 85% to prevent issues
