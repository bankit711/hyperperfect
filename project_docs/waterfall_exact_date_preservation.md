# Waterfall Exact Date Preservation

## Summary
Modified the waterfall operation to preserve exact dates in the cohort column instead of truncating to the first day of the month.

## Problem
Previously, when using MonthlyCohorts:
- Source data: January 31, 2024 (Excel serial 45323)
- Cohort column: "Jan 2024" (loses day information)
- Effect: All dates in January would appear as the same cohort

## Solution
Changed the implementation to preserve the exact Excel serial date:

### 1. Modified `parseMonthlyCohort` in waterfallUtiltiies.js
```javascript
// Before:
return {
  cohortValue: `${monthNames[monthNum - 1]} ${year}`,  // "Jan 2024"
  sortValue: year * 12 + monthNum,
};

// After:
return {
  cohortValue: cellValue, // Keep the original Excel serial number (45323)
  sortValue: cellValue,    // Excel serial dates are already sortable
};
```

### 2. Updated date format in waterfallController.js
```javascript
// Before:
cohortRange.numberFormat = "mmm yyyy";  // Displays as "Jan 2024"

// After:
cohortRange.numberFormat = "m/d/yy";    // Displays as "1/31/24"
```

## Benefits
1. **Exact Date Preservation**: January 31, 2024 stays as 1/31/24, not 1/1/24
2. **Better Granularity**: Can distinguish between different days within the same month
3. **Correct Sorting**: Excel serial dates naturally sort in chronological order
4. **No Data Loss**: The original date information is preserved

## How It Works
1. The source "Start Month" column contains Excel serial dates (e.g., 45323)
2. `parseMonthlyCohort` validates the date but returns the original serial number
3. The serial number is placed in the cohort column
4. Excel's number formatting displays it as "m/d/yy" (e.g., "1/31/24")
5. Formulas and calculations work with the exact date values

## Example
- Source Start Month: 45323 (January 31, 2024)
- Cohort Column Value: 45323 (stored as number)
- Display Format: "1/31/24"
- Previous Display: "Jan 2024" (lost day information)

## Testing
Created test file `waterfallExactDate.test.js` to verify:
- Excel serial dates are preserved
- Correct number formatting is applied
- Dates sort properly
- Day information is not lost

## Notes
- This change only affects MonthlyCohorts
- QuarterlyCohorts and AnnualCohorts continue to work as before
- The change is backward compatible - existing waterfalls will update their display format when regenerated
