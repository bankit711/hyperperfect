Hey {{ contact.FIRSTNAME | default: "there" }},

Two things changed in HyperPerfect that you'll notice the next time you open it.

**Auto Mode is now the default**
HyperPerfect reads each request and picks the right AI for it. Simple questions get fast answers. Complex analysis gets full reasoning. You stop paying for power you don't need, and you don't have to think about which mode to use. If you want to override, type @mode.

**HyperPerfect can now work as a team**
For complex tasks — building a model, analyzing a large dataset, checking formulas across multiple sheets — HyperPerfect can now deploy specialists that work in parallel on different parts of the job. One on the Income Statement, one on the Balance Sheet, one checking your work. All at the same time.

This is early, but it's already the fastest way to get through a complex model.
