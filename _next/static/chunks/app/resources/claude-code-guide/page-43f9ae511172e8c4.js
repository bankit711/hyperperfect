The company is headquartered in San Francisco and has raised over $7 billion in funding.","Anthropic's core differentiator is its safety-first approach to AI development. While OpenAI has pursued rapid commercialization, Anthropic has invested heavily in interpretability research — understanding what's happening inside AI models. Their Constitutional AI methodology trains models to be helpful, harmless, and honest without relying purely on human feedback.","Claude, Anthropic's flagship model family, has become a serious competitor to OpenAI's GPT models. Claude consistently ranks at or near the top of independent benchmarks for coding, reasoning, and analysis tasks. Many enterprise users report that Claude produces more reliable, nuanced outputs — particularly for complex multi-step work.","In the enterprise market, Anthropic has overtaken OpenAI. As of mid-2025, Claude holds 32% of enterprise LLM market share by usage versus OpenAI's 25% — a dramatic reversal from 2023 when OpenAI held 50%. In coding specifically, Claude commands 54% of the enterprise market. The company's revenue has surged from $1B in early 2025 to a $9B run rate by year-end, with 85% coming from over 300,000 business customers. Microsoft, Amazon (via AWS Bedrock), and Google Cloud are all major partners or customers.","Anthropic's approach to model development emphasizes longer context windows (up to 200K tokens), stronger instruction following, and more consistent behavior across conversations. Their focus on developer tools like Claude Code reflects a strategy of building AI that integrates deeply into professional workflows rather than just answering questions."]},features:[{label:"Reads & Writes Files",description:"Originally meant for Python and other kinds of code-based files, but now handles MSFT Office, PDFs, and just about everything else.",color:"#4EC98B",link:"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/technology/claude-code.html?unlocked_article_code=1.IVA.pCM_.CM3FuHMnqb7n&smid=url-share"},{label:"Suddenly Web Savvy",description:"Newly released Chrome extension allows it to interact with Websites for you.",color:"#5B8DEF",link:"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome"},{label:"Easy to Use, Hard to Master",description:"Not hard to get started and do some impressive tasks.
